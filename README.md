# challenge-nodejs-typescript

This project is a challenge that uses Nest.js as its framework. It contains three resources (agents, customers and orders) with their respective CRUD endpoints. It also includes pagination when we need to list orders and three special endpoints of orders when we only need the total amount of money grouped by customers, by agents, or by countries.

The endpoints of the resources are:

- [ ] /api/agents
- [ ] /api/customers
- [ ] /api/orders

The documentation (swagger) can be found at:

- [ ] /api/docs
